FAQ
=====

## What is Vöid?

Vöid is an all-in-one custom firmware for the Ninteno Switch based on [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/README.md), in the same kin as Kosmos, entirely focussing on ease of use for any one that wants to set up custom firmware on their Nintento Switch without much effort.

## Why "Vöid"

Atmosphere is named from the layer of gasses around the world, and Kosmos is named after, well, the Cosmos. Both astroligical in nature, Vöid is named from the enmptiness of space, and to "fill the void" of Kosmos.

## Where do I find Sigpatches?

Sigpatches are not provided by default, but you can find them on GBATemp quite easily.
