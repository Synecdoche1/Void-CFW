Vöid is a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch, based on ScireM's [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/README.md).

This is in no way coded, or made by me, only very slight changes and is intended to be an all-in-one packages to make installing customer firmware painless.

# How To Use

Download the ZIP in the releases section, unzip the file to a folder of your choosing. Three folders are included in this pack, SD Card, Payloads and PC. Just drag and drop the contents of the SD Card folder onto the root of your SD Card. Insert it into your Switch and inject Hekate as you normally would. Launch either SsysNAND or emuNAND as usual, and you're good to go!

FAQ
=====

## What is Vöid?

Vöid is an all-in-one custom firmware for the Ninteno Switch based on [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/README.md), in the same kin as Kosmos, entirely focussing on ease of use for any one that wants to set up custom firmware on their Nintento Switch without much effort.

## Why "Vöid"?

Atmosphere is named from the layer of gasses around the world, and Kosmos is named after, well, the Cosmos. Both astroligical in nature, Vöid is named from the emptiness of space, and to "fill the void" of Kosmos.

## Where do I find Sigpatches?

Sigpatches are not provided by default, but you can find them on GBATemp quite easily.
