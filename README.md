Vöid is a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch, based on ScireM's [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/README.md).

This is in no way coded, or made by me, only very slight changes and is intended to be an all-in-one packages to make installing customer firmware painless.

# DISCLAIMER

***MAKE A NAND BACK UP THROUGH HEKATE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING TO YOUR SWITCH! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!***

I am not in any way responsible for anything that happens to your Switch, nor would I expect anything to happen. Use at your own discretion. When modifying anything on your Switch you are always at risk at possible damage, or an account ban from Nintendo. Use at your own risk.

# How To Use

Download the ZIP in the releases section, unzip the file to a folder of your choosing. Three folders are included in this pack, SD Card, Payloads and PC. Just drag and drop the contents of the SD Card folder onto the root of your SD Card. Insert it into your Switch and inject Hekate as you normally would. Launch either SsysNAND or emuNAND as usual, and you're good to go!

# Features

- Drag and drop, ready to use from the moment you inject your payload!
- Works on all Firmware versions, providing you can inject the payload.
- Incognito enabled by default, using Atmosphere's new Incognito, which doesn't require a back up, or writing directly to NAND!
  - Enabled for both sysNAND and emuNAND.
  - ***WARNING: THIS IS NOT KNOWN TO BE SAFE AND DOES NOT GUARENTEE YOU PROTECTION.*** 
- Ready to use homebrew apps, all up to date. Just open your album on the Switch, and have fun!
- Up-To-Date Atmosphere, always!
- PC Tools available in the Zip, to get you started!
- Payloads available to use with a Payload launcher.
- Lightweight! The total size is only:
  - SD Card: 70.7MB
  - PC Apps: 12.1MB
  - Payloads: 364KB

FAQ
=====

## What is Vöid?

Vöid is an all-in-one custom firmware for the Ninteno Switch based on [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/README.md), in the same kin as Kosmos, entirely focussing on ease of use for anyone that wants to set up custom firmware on their Nintento Switch without much effort.

## Why "Vöid"?

Atmosphere is named from the layer of gasses around the world, and Kosmos is named after, well, the Cosmos. Both astroligical in nature, Vöid is named from the emptiness of space, and to "fill the void" of Kosmos.

## Where do I find Sigpatches?

Sigpatches are not provided by default, but you can find them on GBA Temp quite easily. 

## You said Incognito isn't known to be safe, what else can I do to protect myself?

First of all, do not install pirated games and run them on your account and then connect to the internet. That is a sure way to get banned.
If you do want to connect to the internet, and use applications such as Homebrew Appstore, then I'd highly recommend [90DNS](https://gbatemp.net/threads/90dns-dns-server-for-blocking-all-nintendo-servers.516234/)

## Can I contribute?

Sure! Hit me up with a message on what you'd want to do/add and we'll talk from there.

Discord: Synecdoche#2077

## Where's your Patreon page?

I don't have one, nor do I feel like adding one. This pack at the time of writing is entirely just an easy to use bundle of what you can make yourself, and taking money from what is almost no effort at this time doesn't sit well with me. If I do end up creating my own apps for this bundle, then I may consider it.
