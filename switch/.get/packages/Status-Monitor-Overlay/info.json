  "details": "Monitor Your hardware in real time!\\n\\nThis is an overlay homebrew dedicated to Nintendo Switch. You need to have installed Tesla environment to use it.\\n\\nTool contains three modes to choose, each one is explained here : https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay/blob/master/docs/modes.md\\n\\nYou can exit from selected mode by pressing and holding Left Stick + Right Stick. To exit from main menu press B.\\n\\nIf it's not working in dock, you need to first start Status Monitor, then put Nintendo Switch to dock.\\n\\nWhat is currently supported:\\n\\nCPU Usage for each core (Cores #0-#2 are used by apps/games, Core #3 is used by OS, background processes and also Tesla overlays)\\nGPU Load\\nCPU, GPU & RAM actual frequency\\nUsed RAM categorized to: (not supported by FWs <5.0.0)\\nTotal\\nApplication\\nApplet\\nSystem\\nSystem Unsafe\\nSoC, PCB & Skin temperatures (Skin temperature not supported by FWs <5.0.0)\\nFan Rotation Level\\nPFPS and FPS (with help of NX-FPS, more info in repo. Not installing it results in not showing FPS counters on overlay)\\nPlanned:\\nAdd Graph mode\\n\\nRequirements:\\n\\nFrom 0.4.1 you need Tesla Menu >=1.0.2\\n\\nThanks to:\\n\\nRetroNX channel for helping with coding stuff\\nSunTheCourier for sys-clk-Overlay from which I learned how to make my own Tesla homebrew\\nHerbaciarz for providing screenshots from HDMI Grabber\\nFAQ:\\nQ: This homebrew has any impact on games?\\n\\nA: Negligible, you won't see any difference. Almost everything is done on Core #3, other cores usage is below 0.001%.\\n\\nTroubleshooting:\\nQ: Game sometimes hangs when using Status Monitor Overlay. Why?\\n\\nA: This is because of dmnt:cht nature. Some games don't like that it's peaking constantly at its memory and they stuck. This happens only if you are using NX-FPS plugin. Solution is to just close Status Monitor Overlay (you don't need to close Tesla Menu) and wait few seconds until game will resume.",
  "changelog": "0.6.1\\n\\nFix issue related to always forcing opening cheat process with dmnt:cht that sometimes resulted in conflicts with other tools.\\nNow it's checking first if cheat process is opened already.\\n\\n\\n0.6.0\\n\\nIf dmnt:cht is not detected, it's using svc calls to read FPS values for NX-FPS (now only if SaltyNX check failed, FPS Counter won't show).\\nBe aware that not using Atmosphere's dmnt:cht may introduce conflicts with other cheat engines, resulting in crashes or hangs.\\n\\n0.5.4\\n\\nFix issue with CPU Core usage stuck at last value when core usage is at peak.\\n\\n0.5.3\\n\\nUpdated to libnx 3.2.0, which helps with very rare case of crashing overlay if pl sessions are depleted.\\nFixed wrong version inside overlay\\n\\n0.5.2\\n\\nAdded version info for Tesla menu\\nAdded support for SX OS (FPS Counter is not available)"
