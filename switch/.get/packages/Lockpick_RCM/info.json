  "description": "encryption key derivation bare metal RCM",
  "details": "Description\\n\\nLockpick_RCM is a bare metal Nintendo Switch payload that derives encryption keys for use in Switch file handling software like hactool, hactoolnet/LibHac, ChoiDujour, etc. without booting Horizon OS.\\n\\nDue to changes imposed by firmware 7.0.0, Lockpick homebrew can no longer derive the latest keys. In the boot-time environment however, there are fewer limitations. That means the new keys are finally easy to dump!\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nLaunch Lockpick_RCM.bin using your favorite payload injector\\nUpon completion, keys will be saved to /switch/prod.keys on SD\\nIf the console has Firmware 7.x, the /sept/ folder from Atmosph√®re or Kosmos release zip containing both sept-primary.bin and sept-secondary.enc must be present on SD or else only keyblob master key derivation is possible (ie. up to master_key_05 only)\\nBig thanks to CTCaer\\nFor Hekate and all the advice while developing this!\\n\\nKnown Issues\\n\\nChainloading from SX will hang immediately due to quirks in their hwinit code, please launch payload directly",
  "changelog": "v1.8.3\\n\\nImproved the general aes-xts crypto function to match the diskio algorithm (only 2 total aes-ecb calls instead of one per block) and perform the xor operations in 32-bit chunks. Also updated for gcc 10 and merged latest Hekate commits.\\n\\nSysmmc runs get a slight speed improvement, emummc gets a large speed improvement, especially file-based.\\n\\nAlso now supports parsing sept from sept-secondary if FSS0 entry is present in hekate_ipl.ini\\n\\nv1.8.2\\n\\nVersion 10.0.0, in addition to having new key offsets, expands the 80000000000000E1 common ticket save. This revealed a bug in remap init code, now fixed. Also fixed a bug caused by missing ES saves.\\n\\nv1.8.1.\\n\\nFixed BIS key off-by-one index issue for new consoles, fixed titlekey regression\\n\\nv1.8.0\\n\\nLockpick_RCM now supports firmware 9.1.0. Like in update 9.0.0, the root keys didn't change and so consoles on any version from 8.1.0-9.1.0 will dump all current keys.\\n\\nMinerva should be updated on SD to use its performance benefits. If the old library is present, Minerva will not activate.\\n\\nAlso corrected bug where SD seed verification vector was being read from sysnand even when dumping keys from emunand.\\n\\n\\n\\nv1.7.1\\n\\nFixes freezes under certain conditions, now has a Payload menu like Hekate's that allows chainloading to payloads in bootloader/payloads, atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin, or ReiNX.bin\\n\\nv1.7.0\\n\\nLockpick_RCM now parses the ES save files correctly for much quicker Titlekey extraction, ie linear in number of titlekeys rather than checking the whole save container\\n\\nHuge thanks to @Thealexbarney for an excellent source of truth on save parsing in the form of https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac/ and for answering so many questions about it on top of all the hard work reversing FS and constantly improving LibHac\\n\\nAlso corrected a major bug in Hekate's heap code (please do the same if you use Hekate code in your own projects! ref CTCaer/hekate#300 ) and eliminated a few of my own memory leaks, both guaranteed and potential\\n\\nv1.6.4\\n\\nFile write validation is sufficient\\n\\nv1.6.3\\n\\nFixes bad directory check preventing writing keyfiles\\n\\nv1.6.1\\n\\nWhen I added Minerva and titlekey dumping I moved the key save text buffer from a zero-initialized stack array to the heap, and forgot to zero-initialize, followed by many perilous calls to strlen on the buffer which wasn't guaranteed any nulls to terminate! This resulted in a hang while saving keys and/or corrupt key files\\n\\nv1.6.0\\n\\nAdded titlekey dumping! With CTCaer's Minerva it runs in 20-25s depending on sys/emunand, or 40-50s without.\\nAlso added key generation number display to main menu to help guide your sysnand/emunand dumping decision.\\n\\nv1.5.0\\n\\nNow lets users choose whether to dump keys from sysNAND or emuMMC. Also a fix for BIS key generation on consoles released after firmware 5.0.0 (presently it's rare that these have code execution, but eventually this will apply to more).\\n\\nv1.4.0\\n\\nAdded Keys for 9.0.0\\nAlso added BPMP overclock\\n\\nv1.3\\n\\nSupports new keys if run on firmware 8.1.0.\\n\\nv1.2\\n\\nThe main visible differences are that if it's run on a dev console it will correctly name the key file dev.keys and if an upgrade or downgrade fails to install a matching set of package1 and package2, Lockpick_RCM will try every key it can instead of giving up on finding FS keys.\\n\\nv1.1.1\\n\\nFix smmu emulation for tsec on 6.2.0\\n\\nv1.1\\n\\nNow includes support for firmware 8.0.0 along with a big speed increase thanks to advice from CTCaer. Interpolated recent hekate bugfixes as well"
