  "details": "nx-ovlloader is basically nx-hbloader ported to run as a sysmodule. It runs in the background and loads overlay NROs (.ovl files) given to it.",
  "changelog": "1.0.6\\n\\nA check preventing Tesla from running (and crashing / causing issues) on firmwares bellow 9.0.0 went missing with the last release. This re-adds that check again. Thanks to @friedkeenan\\n\\n1.0.5\\n\\nIncreased stack and heap size a bit again to prevent issues people were facing with certain overlays\\n\\n1.0.4\\n\\nUpdate to work with firmware version 10.0.0\\nReduced stack size to 0x10000 and heap to 0x400000\\nPLEASE MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE /atmosphere/contents/010000000007E51A FOLDER WHEN UPDATING!!!\\n\\n1.0.3\\n\\nBefore, libtesla exhausted service sessions which made qlaunch crash on firmwares lower than 9.0.0. nx-ovlloader now gracefully exits instead of making qlaunch crash.\\n\\nIf you're using a firmware lower than 9.0.0, please update!\\n\\n1.0.2\\n\\nThis version allows changing of the default overlay's argvs without having to overwrite the default nro path using envSetNextLoad\\n\\n1.0.1\\n\\nIf there's no ovlmenu.ovl present on the SD card, instead of fataling Tesla now gracefully exits and will try loading it again on next restart (or when enabled by the Kosmos Toolbox for example)"
